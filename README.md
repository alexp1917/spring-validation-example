# Spring Validation Example

It uses jakarta api rather than the javax api, not sure which way is best, 
but this is what worked for me.

to run it, import into IntelliJ, click on the test folder in the 'Project' 
sidebar view, and then Select `Run tests in 'org.validation...` from the 
context menu (`Ctrl+Shift+F10`). Or run this in the command line:

```bash
./gradlew cleanTest test --info
```
